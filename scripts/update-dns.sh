#!/usr/bin/env bash
# update-dns.sh — points one hostname at one ALB (UPSERT), or removes a
# hostname entirely (DELETE), always using the record's actual current
# value rather than one a human has to know or paste in.
#
# This exists specifically to replace hand-typed `aws route53
# change-resource-record-sets` commands copied out of a markdown doc — that
# pattern is exactly how a stale ALB hostname ends up permanently in
# Route53: someone copies the command once, runs it again later after the
# ALB was recreated, and forgets to swap in the new hostname first. It's
# also how a DELETE ends up needing a manually-pasted "current value" that
# nobody actually re-checked. This script looks the current value up itself
# for DELETE, and takes it as a fresh argument (usually piped straight from
# `kubectl get ingress`) for UPSERT — either way, nothing here can be a
# stale copy-paste.
#
# This intentionally does NOT introduce a cluster controller (like
# external-dns) to fully automate this — see ARCHITECTURE.md for why. It's
# still a manually-triggered step; it's just no longer a hand-typed one.
#
# Usage:
#   ./update-dns.sh upsert <hostname> <alb-hostname>
#   ./update-dns.sh delete <hostname>
# Examples:
#   ./update-dns.sh upsert dev-app.rashmidevops.xyz k8s-abc123-456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
#   ./update-dns.sh delete dev-app.rashmidevops.xyz
